# keyboard_journey
This is my first prototype for a fully custom split keyboard. \
A pcb can be ordered with the gerber files, og customizations can be made to the ergogen file or afterwards in KiCad. Note that it is in ergogen v3, specifically Ben Vallacks fork that includes some handy footprints and v4 introduced breaking changes. That can be installed here: https://github.com/benvallack/ergogen \
I have now built it and flashed firmware, it works great and is currently the board that I use for all my typing. \
Firmware can be found at https://github.com/asmund20/zmk-config, and the newest build can be downloaded directly from actions. The keymap is not yet finalised, but you should personalize that for yourself regardless. \
Will make a full parts list and some building instructions some time in the future.
