# keyboard_journey
This is my first prototype for a fully custom split keyboard. \
I have now built it and flashed firmware, it works great! \
Firmware can be found at https://github.com/asmund20/zmk-config, and the newest build can be downloaded directly from actions. The keymap is not yet finalised, but you should personalize that for yourself regardless. \
Will make a full parts list and some building instructions.
